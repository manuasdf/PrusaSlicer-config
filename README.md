# PrusaSlicer configs

My config files for modified or self-built printers.

## FLSun QQ-S

I replaced the board on my FLSun QQ-S with a [Duet 3 Mini 5+][https://www.duet3d.com/duet3mini5plus]. As I slicer I prefer the PrusaSlicer. A config file to import in PrusaSlicer as bundle config is included in this directory. 

## renkforce

I replaced the original board with the previous board of the FLSun. It's a [Robin mini][http://official.flsun3d.com/product/17.html]. It got new stepper diver [TMC2209][https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/TMC2209_datasheet_rev1.08.pdf], which are frankly over-powered for the task.
